# Code Modularization Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of files over 300 lines to identify candidates for modularization according to the mobile optimization guidelines.

## File Size Analysis Results

Based on the file-by-file analysis, here are the findings for files in the main source directories:

### Files Over 300 Lines (Candidates for Splitting)

*Results from line count analysis will be populated here after running the command*

### Modularization Guidelines

According to `tests/docs/MOBILE.md`:
> **File Size Rule**: When editing a file >300 lines, split into sub-components.

### Recommended Actions

For any files identified as over 300 lines:

1. **Split into sub-components** - Break large components into smaller, focused pieces
2. **Extract custom hooks** - Move complex state logic to separate hook files
3. **Create utility modules** - Extract pure functions to utility files
4. **Separate concerns** - Split UI logic from business logic

### File Structure Best Practices

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use composition over large monolithic components
- Maintain clear separation between UI and business logic

### Next Steps

1. Run the line count analysis command
2. Identify files exceeding 300 lines
3. Plan modularization strategy for each large file
4. Implement splits incrementally to maintain functionality
