Okay here is what I saw we ahve compeleted for phase 0 of the goals prd:

"Absolutely! Let's begin implementing the Goals v1 transformation. Based on your PRD, I'll start with Phase 0 - Schema prep & cleanup since it's the foundation for everything else.

Let me implement the key changes step by step:

Phase 0: Schema Prep & Cleanup
First, let's add the Goal interface to types.ts and remove the bad habit fields:

client/src/types.ts
Now let's create the Goals CRUD hook:

client/src/hooks/useGoals.ts
Now let's create a feature flag system and update the compound utility to remove bad habit logic:

client/src/utils/featureFlags.ts
client/src/utils/compound.ts
Let's also update the debug success rate utility to remove bad habit logic:

client/src/utils/debug-success-rate.ts
Now let's update the mock data to remove bad habit data and add goals:

client/src/data/mockData.ts
Let's also update the mock data generation to only generate good habit logs:

Now let's update the data service to include goals:

client/src/services/dataService.ts
This completes Phase 0 of the implementation! I've:

✅ Updated types.ts - Added Goal interface, removed badHabit fields, removed BAD state
✅ Created useGoals.ts - Full CRUD operations for goals
✅ Added feature flags - GOALS_V1 flag (dev only for now)
✅ Updated compound logic - Removed bad habit calculations
✅ Updated mock data - Added goals, removed bad habit logs
✅ Updated data service - Added goals support
The foundation is now ready for Phase 1 (Goals page skeleton). The feature flag ensures existing functionality remains unchanged until we're ready to activate the new system."

You also stated we have completed this:

"Looking at the codebase and console logs, here's what we've already completed from Phase 0 of the Goals PRD:

✅ Completed Phase 0 Items:
Types - ✅ DONE

Goal interface added to types.ts
HabitPair extended with goalIds?: string[]
HabitLogState updated (removed 'bad', kept 'good'/'unlogged')
Goals plumbing - ✅ DONE
