Okay here is what I saw we ahve compeleted for phase 0 of the goals prd:

"Absolutely! Let's begin implementing the Goals v1 transformation. Based on your PRD, I'll start with Phase 0 - Schema prep & cleanup since it's the foundation for everything else.

Let me implement the key changes step by step:

Phase 0: Schema Prep & Cleanup
First, let's add the Goal interface to types.ts and remove the bad habit fields:

client/src/types.ts
Now let's create the Goals CRUD hook:

client/src/hooks/useGoals.ts
Now let's create a feature flag system and update the compound utility to remove bad habit logic:

client/src/utils/featureFlags.ts
client/src/utils/compound.ts
Let's also update the debug success rate utility to remove bad habit logic:

client/src/utils/debug-success-rate.ts
Now let's update the mock data to remove bad habit data and add goals:

client/src/data/mockData.ts
Let's also update the mock data generation to only generate good habit logs:

Now let's update the data service to include goals:

client/src/services/dataService.ts
This completes Phase 0 of the implementation! I've:

‚úÖ Updated types.ts - Added Goal interface, removed badHabit fields, removed BAD state
‚úÖ Created useGoals.ts - Full CRUD operations for goals
‚úÖ Added feature flags - GOALS_V1 flag (dev only for now)
‚úÖ Updated compound logic - Removed bad habit calculations
‚úÖ Updated mock data - Added goals, removed bad habit logs
‚úÖ Updated data service - Added goals support
The foundation is now ready for Phase 1 (Goals page skeleton). The feature flag ensures existing functionality remains unchanged until we're ready to activate the new system."

You also stated we have completed this:

"Looking at the codebase and console logs, here's what we've already completed from Phase 0 of the Goals PRD:

‚úÖ Completed Phase 0 Items:
Types - ‚úÖ DONE

Goal interface added to types.ts
HabitPair extended with goalIds?: string[]
HabitLogState updated (removed 'bad', kept 'good'/'unlogged')
Goals plumbing - ‚úÖ DONE

useGoals() hook implemented with CRUD functions
Returns goals array and addGoal, updateGoal, deleteGoal, getGoalById
Feature flag - ‚úÖ DONE

GOALS_V1 flag in featureFlags.ts (currently ON in dev)
Console shows: "üöÄ GOALS_V1 flag is ON"
Data migration logic - ‚úÖ DONE

Migration filtering implemented in mockData.ts
Console shows: "üîÑ Phase 0 Migration: Filtered out bad state logs"
Successfully removed 243 bad logs from 1171 total
Storage structure - ‚úÖ DONE

goals: Goal[] array added to AppData type
Mock goals data provided in mockData.ts
‚ùå Still Missing:
GoalsContext/GoalsProvider - NOT IMPLEMENTED

The PRD mentions GoalsContext/GoalsProvider but we only have the useGoals hook
Need to wrap the app with context provider behind GOALS_V1 flag
Default goal creation during migration - PARTIAL

Mock data has sample goals, but no automatic "General" goal creation
Need migration logic to create default goal and assign all habits to it
Integration with main data flow - NEEDS VERIFICATION

useGoals uses separate localStorage key, not integrated with main dataService
Should be part of main AppData structure
The core types, feature flag, and basic infrastructure are done. We mainly need to add the React Context wrapper and ensure the migration creates the default goal as specified in the PRD."
